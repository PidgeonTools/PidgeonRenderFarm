or go to ``Control Panel`` -> ``System and Security`` -> ``Windows Defender Firewall`` -> ``Advanced settings`` -> add your custom (TCP)-port to the firewall.

### Linux
Run the following commands. It will add an **firewall exception**. Be sure to **replace ``<your port>``** with the one you set in the settings!

``firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=<your port>/tcp``

``firewall-cmd --reload``

### MacOS
It is the easiest to just disable the firewall entirely.
